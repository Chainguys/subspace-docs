# F.A.Q

## What is Subspace?
<details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    <p>
    The Subspace Network is a protocol focused on solving some of the core systemic issues facing the crypto industry. Things like energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, global level scalability, and ensuring decentralization.
    </p>
    <p>
    We call our protocol a fourth generation blockchain. This is because we are the first protocol to fundamentally overcome the blockchain trilemma as its described by Vitalik Buterin. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This means we can support mass participation in consensus, by ordinary people with commodity hardware. In addition to a low barrier to entry for consensus we decouple our execution from consensus to allow for Billions of accounts, Billions of transactions, & Millions of transactions per second. All of this is possible with on-chain computation, and on-chain storage. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Due to the Subspace Networks Scalability, Speed, & Decentralization we believe it to be a perfect fit as an infrastructure layer for the entire blockchain ecosystem, including NFTs, dApps, & even entire layer one protocols and their ecosystems'

    <p>
    Currently we have our non-incentivized testnet, which we are regularly breaking and updating. We hope to continue to troubleshoot and resolve any bugs we find, with an incentivized testnet coming near the middle of the year. We hope to launch our mainnet later this year.

## What makes Subspace different from other cryptocurrencies?
<details>
    <summary>Details</summary>
    <p>
    Our protocol is best used for scalable, permanent, decentralized storage & computation. Subspace Network is not designed as digital cash, digital gold, or a speculative token. It is an Infrastructure Token.
